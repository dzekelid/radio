  gives its users the chance to take part in a rich community of audio creators broadcasting
  thousands of shows, tracks, and playlists: they can listen to rising talents, or
  upload their own creations to share easily with blogs, sites, and social networks.
  Talents can use a professional mixing console (available both on web and mobile)
  to create their own mixes of voice, music and sound effects. And it is possible
  to broadcast live streams or just record sounds.'
